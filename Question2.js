//   2-QUESTION.Define a callback function before you use it in forEach, map, filter or reduce.

      //  Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function,
      //  to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as
      //  arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the
      //  callback function gets executed.
